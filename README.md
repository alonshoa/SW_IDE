# SW_IDE (Self Writing IDE)

This repo is a test on handling an entire project, all written using the codex language model,
either in Complete mode or the Edit mode For the codex model.  The point is to try different methods to generate using a prompt and the code template to develop full features in the application. 
Nearly all of the code in this project was generated by the model, using only some guidance and verification of the code from my side.

### the following lines were generated by Codex in Edit mode
